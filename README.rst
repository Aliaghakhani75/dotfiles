=============
Configuration
=============

This is my repository of personal configuration settings for various
pieces of software. Feel free to look around.

I use this repository as follows:

* A clone (and checkout) of this repo is placed somewhere in my home
  directory, usually in ``~/Configuration/``.

* My home directory contains various symlinks to the files and
  directories in this repository, e.g. ``~/.bashrc`` points to
  ``~/Configuration/Bash/bashrc``.

* The ``update-symlinks`` script installs/updates these symlinks, based
  on the configuration specified in the ``symlinks.conf`` file.
