This is the latest version of the Jinja2 syntax file for vim with the ability to detect either HTML or Jinja.

There are two reasons I made this repository:

* The version of this vim addon is out-of-date on vimscripts.

* I wanted to manage this syntax file with vim-addons-manager or whatever other vim plugins managers there are.

The current version is the [2011-5-13 version](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/commit/ef30ab56abc955593879f1348c4097cf956177b7) from the official jinja repository. 
If you notice there is a newer version available please message me.
